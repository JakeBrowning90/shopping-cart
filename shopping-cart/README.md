# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This project demonstrates use of react-router-dom to create an app which can switch between two different components each in their own route and accessible through Links in the header. The route practice was relatively straight forward, so I invested a little more time in implementing some CSS skills which I hadn't used in awhile. I used a sticky header and footer, as well as a sticky div for the shopping cart quantity. I also implemented a flexible grid to display a varying amount of item cards per row based on the width of the browser window. I themed the app after Animal Crossing to go with the "shopping" theme without getting too bogged down in style choices.

One aspect of the assignment which I mostly glossed over was the use of React tests. The curriculum seemed somewhat disparate from everything else, and by the time I reached that part of the project, everything was already working as expected. I plan to come back and work more on how to correctly implement tests in the future, but for the moment, it feels like my projects are at such a small scope that they are easier to test in browser.
